## Further Developments/Improvements
Take into account responsive design, add more features such as video or picture examples of exercises,
better organisation of data from API 

## Key Learnings

## Approach and Process

Wireframing, having an idea of how the website should look like, take into account essential website components like
navigation bar, footer. Arrangement of data and fetching API, planning out the routes of the website and link them.
Use of React Hooks like useState, UseEffect, useContext, useReducer. 

## Post Mortem
Creating a single page application using React has been a challenge. Doing this project has helped me reinforced some concepts
in react such as the basic hooks, manipulating API and reminds me the importance of fundamental coding conceptions. It also allowed
me to explore some CSS like tailwindCSS and its libraries. Looking forward to more exciting coding challenges to come.
